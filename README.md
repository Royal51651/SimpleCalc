Imagine this. You're sitting in your cubicle, filling out some paperwork like always. Your coffee has gone cold and boredom rears it's ugly head. But then, you remember something. You remember that you installed...

# SimpleCalc!!!

Despite the name, SimpleCalc is anything but simple. It includes the latest in advanced visual effects, engaging sound design, and a simplistic yet elegant user-interface. This all culminates in what is one of, if not the most interesting calculators to ever have been programmed!!! It's cross-platform, blazingly fast due to it's rust-backend, and beautiful thanks to over 100 carefully selected lines of CSS and JSX. 

# But, Why?

SimpleCalc started off as a project to learn React, improve my CSS skills, and get familiar with the Tauri framework. However, I realized that there needed to be a distinct feature. Something that no other calculator had. I decided the best feature was visual and sound effects creating the most engaging calculator experience ever.
